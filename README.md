### ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Warning

This application's solver is a simple backtracking algorithm with an exponential time complexity of approximately $O(n^m)$, where n is the number of possibilities for each cell and m is the number of cells. While it works well for standard 9x9 boards, it becomes significantly slower for larger grids.

**It is strongly recommended not to attempt to use the solve or hint feature on boards larger than 16x16 or start games with 1 or more pre-filled cells on a 16x16 game or larger.** This corresponds to a **Sudoku board size** setting of `4`, as shown in the screenshot below. The solver may take a very long time to find a solution or verify that one exists on larger boards.
